## [0.3.0a1] - 2026-10-07 (pre-release)

**This is a pre-release.** `v0.3.0a1` is the first alpha of the v0.3 line, a
research preview. It is prepared at the documentation checkpoint that follows
Section P and the ledger entries O252 to O255 -- **not** after phase P2
closed. P2, *v0.3 Durable Program Runtime + Autonomy Contract
Base*, is in progress, its gate is not met, and every open gate below is listed
as NOT_YET_PROVEN. The latest stable release is still `v0.1.0`. P1 was completed
as an internal development milestone. No public v0.2 release was cut; the latest
stable public release remains v0.1.0 while the development line continues
through P2.

`pyproject.toml` carries `0.3.0a1`. The pre-release is installed from the tagged
source and is not published to PyPI: the distribution workflow of this
repository accepts only the audited `v0.1.0`. `docs/READINESS.md` reads
`TECHNICALLY_STABLE_READY = no`, and this pre-release does not claim otherwise.
The board is measured at commit `75214e31`, not at the commit that carries this
release: it is conservative (its `attribution` and `tests` rows predate the
entries and the run that now close them), and it is not regenerated at the cut
because regeneration needs the network (the `clean_install` row and the union
gate's wheel build call the package index).

**Integrity gate: met for the paths its reviewers replayed, with one residual
stated.** The condition for cutting this alpha is that its runtime cannot turn
a run that was blocked for a capability violation into an ACCEPTED one. Two
merges carry it. The qa-arena-write repair (merge `a455edc0`) seals QA's
candidate arena, freezes it in QA's witness, and holds a run that was blocked
for a capability violation: not reported ACCEPTED, not delivered and not
resumed by anything but `hoh unblock`, for every state shape the current build
writes. The qaw-followup merge (`ab41589f`) closes the three findings that the
repair's integration reviewer had proved and that kept this gate open when this
checkpoint was first drafted: a violation state written before the hold
existed is no longer unblocked by the resume loop (it is refused and the
launcher verdict is UNDETERMINED, not ACCEPTED); the acceptance record counts
an open QA seal as a problem; a `seals.jsonl` that is a symlink, a FIFO or has
a second name is refused before a byte is written, so no ledger line reaches a
foreign file; and a forged `planned` line for a sibling arena is honoured only
when it is bound to an arena this run sealed. Both integration reviewers
replayed each of these paths on the merged tree and saw it refused. **What this
does not claim:** that no other false-ACCEPTED or foreign-write path exists --
it covers the replayed paths and what the strand's 13 criteria and 54 mutant
rows pin -- and the residual the strand states and pins itself: a role pane that
has read the run's `arena_secret` can compute the name of a real arena of that
run and have a forged `planned` line for it honoured (a mode change inside the
run's own arena, which the pane could make itself), because the secret is in
`state.json` and the ledger is a record and a restore aid, not an access
control against a process of the same user. Earlier text of this paragraph,
written before the strand merged, said the gate was not met and the release was
held for it; that was correct at the time, and the correction is dated in
`docs/LIMITATIONS.md` (limit 12d). **The repair of the quota misclassification
(failure-classes) is not merged.** The first entries under *Known limitations*
say what that costs.

The central invariant of this development line, which every section below
assumes:

    candidate creation != product acceptance != integration acceptance != merge authority != phase closure

### Added

* **HoH builds HoH's own kernel.** Since 2026-09-23 product runs have written
  modules under `src/hoh/`. From 2026-09-25 on, every such run worked in an
  isolated clone pinned to one commit, its accepted candidate was imported byte
  for byte, and two independent integration reviewers released it before the
  orchestrating session merged it: 46 product-run merges `[V01]`, 34 of which
  change `src/hoh/` `[V02]`. In the ledger entries O236 to O254, 26 candidates
  the product had accepted were refused at integration review `[V07t]`.
* **Durable programme runtime (P2).** Durable timers, a sentinel, a never-stuck
  check, session succession with a master epoch, a partial leader lease, a
  resume loop that acts on due timers, an autonomy contract, a programme
  checklist bound to the phase gate, and an independent supervisor review of
  the gate. 26 of P2's 43 registered requirements read PROVEN `[V10c]`
  `[V10b]`; P2 is not closed.
* **Project contract and state ownership.** Read-only `hoh project contract`
  commands (`schema`, `check`, `impact`, `owner`, `conflicts`) beside
  `hoh project authority`, `drive` and `handoff`.
* **Evidence model.** The `EvidenceClaim` schema and its entry point
  `tools/evidence_claims.py`; proof classes that keep "built", "tested",
  "integrated", "behaviourally proven" and "gate satisfied" apart; and an
  acceptance record that is refused as `STALE` when the code it describes
  changed after it was taken.
* **Programme gate machinery.** Phase gates bound to the register (a gate item
  that is not bound can no longer read closed), supervisor drift measured
  against a preserved baseline, each acceptance probe bound to its own register
  entry, and a union-gate timeout that reports a stable `NOT_RUN` instead of
  copying an interpreter path into the board.
* **Storage lifecycle (operator amendment A1), and its first self-dogfood.**
  Ownership registry, admission by reservation, durable park and resume under
  storage pressure, verified archive bundles and targets, host adapters, and
  `VERIFIED_RELOCATION` with a per-project storage steward -- the only operation
  that may remove a local copy of project data. `hoh storage init`, `steward`,
  `adopt-project`, `survey-legacy` and `adopt-legacy`, and `hoh resume-storage`.
  Section P ran on the real project: it was adopted, the survey of legacy
  reviewer scratch found 0 of 188 roots eligible `[V33]`, and the steward's real
  pass observed and reclaimed nothing.
* **Registered ephemeral temporary roots (P2-42).** A project-owned temporary
  root; a scratch that is not owned by the user, not private to them or not
  empty is refused; cleanup compares mount ids and removes through directory
  descriptors; and an inode pressure signal sits next to the byte signal. The
  strand took three runs, two of which integration review refused `[V38]`.
* **Every long role prompt goes through a pointer file (prompt-threshold).** A
  role prompt above 8,192 bytes, or holding a character an input box treats
  specially (control, format and private-use characters, tab, carriage
  return), is written to a link-safe file and the agent receives a short
  pointer, so the stalled-submit recovery can verify the box text of every
  first prompt. Claude Code 2.1.292 renders a long inline paste collapsed,
  which had made that recovery fail closed and had blocked three runs of the
  qaw-followup strand before any candidate. The strand was built by a product
  run under one declared deviation, a bootstrap harness (the previous source
  plus only the reviewed dispatcher change), retired at its merge.
* **HoH closes its own role panes and ends a role's processes before the
  freeze (role-pane lifecycle).** It never signals or closes a foreign pane or
  process: a process is ended only when it carries the pane's minted mark and
  is anchored to the pane's own shell (its session or its descendants), a
  signal goes to one process and never a group, and a pane whose role left
  marked processes outside it is refused and named rather than closed. A tests-only follow-up
  (rpl-tests) closed two blocking findings of its integration review.
* **The orchestrating session can be rolled over under a protocol (context
  rollover, Layer A).** `hoh project hold`, `rollover`, `rollover-verify` and
  `rollover-accept` freeze a succession capsule whose entries are derived facts
  that the successor must re-derive, operator decisions kept verbatim and never
  answered by the machine, and advisory context with no authority; the
  successor takes the master epoch only if everything re-derives and
  acknowledges, after a re-verification that sits between the acknowledgement
  and the acquire; a stale predecessor is fenced. It is tested with fakes and
  is **not evidence for any P2 row before its live canary**: the one handoff of
  2026-10-07 was written by hand, before the protocol existed, and does not
  count as one.
* **QA's candidate arena is sealed.** Every write bit under it is cleared for
  QA's dispatch, the plan is on a ledger before the first `chmod`, the arena is
  frozen in QA's witness, and the ways a `hoh run` ends compare the seals they
  leave in place. A capability violation sets a hold that only `hoh unblock`
  lifts, for the states the current build writes, and for the legacy-state,
  open-seal, symlinked-ledger and sibling-plan paths of the follow-up strand.
* **Amendment A5, registered and not built.** Provider and model routing with
  durable failover: five requirements, one per phase, all MISSING `[V40]`.
* **Operator units.** Optional systemd user units under `ops/` for a
  supervised quota resume, an unattended continuation, a storage-pressure
  resume and a per-project steward pass. Nothing installs or enables them.
* **New CLI surface** (development, not a stable interface): `hoh storage`
  (`init`, `steward`, `adopt-project`, `survey-legacy`, `adopt-legacy`),
  `hoh resume-storage`, `hoh timers`, `hoh sentinel`, `hoh stuck`,
  `hoh project` (`authority`, `contract`, `drive`, `handoff`, `hold`,
  `rollover`, `rollover-verify`, `rollover-accept`), and
  `--drive`/`--recover` on `hoh resume-quota`.

### Changed

* **A stalled prompt is a transient, and idle is not done.** A stalled prompt is
  retried; an agent that ends its turn without an answer gets one follow-up;
  after a stalled prompt submit, Enter is pressed once, on the dispatch's own
  prompt, bound to the stall record of that send. Prompts no longer start with
  `/`, and a pane that still holds unsent input is refused instead of typed
  into.
* **Long prompts travel as files.** A role prompt longer than one command-line
  argument is written to a link-safe prompt file and Herdr receives a pointer;
  the dispatcher compares the file against a digest it kept in memory. Since
  the prompt-threshold merge the same path serves every role prompt above 8,192
  bytes and every prompt holding a paste-unsafe character.
* **Candidate ids and anchors.** A resumed iteration gets a fresh candidate id
  (`-i<n>-a<m>`), and the anchor of a candidate never moves a ref.
* **The command guard.** An operator-side policy can sharpen the shipped command
  policy and can never relax it; one mandatory deny rule that never matched is
  fixed and permission-rule forms are checked at load.
* **Disk-full-safe durable writes** cover the first fifteen writers of the
  migration list (P2-41 stays PARTIAL).
* **Artefactual discrimination.** pytest's exit-4 "nothing ran" messages count
  as artefactual, case-insensitively and only at exit 4.

### Fixed

* The capability witness crashed on a file name that is not UTF-8; names are
  now folded with `os.fsencode`, non-UTF-8 text is recorded losslessly in the
  run state, and the digests of UTF-8 names are unchanged.
* A role prompt longer than one argument failed with `Argument list too long`.
* A retry timer could come due before the provider's reset.
* A run held for a capability violation could be reported ACCEPTED, delivered
  or resumed through a pause, and QA could write into its candidate arena
  without the write being noticed: fixed for the states the current build
  writes, and by the follow-up for a legacy violation state, an open seal, a
  symlinked seal ledger and a forged sibling-arena plan line.
* The board's regeneration did not converge because a timeout text carrying a
  home path entered the board; the cause was proven and removed.

### Known limitations at this pre-release, and what is not claimed

Each open gate below is NOT_YET_PROVEN, and a gate that reads red stays red.

* **The integrity gate is met for the replayed paths, not for every path.** The
  qaw-followup merge (`ab41589f`) closed the legacy-state resume, the open
  seal, the symlinked seal ledger and the forged sibling-arena plan line, each
  replayed by both integration reviewers (see the gate paragraph at the top).
  Stated and pinned by the strand itself: a role pane that has read the run's
  `arena_secret` and copies iteration and attempt gets a forged plan honoured
  inside its own run's arena. Tracked minor: the acceptance tool does not count
  link names in a seal ledger (not reachable from the drive, because evidence
  is copied without hard links); a held run under storage pressure is booked as
  `storage_unavailable` (unreachable by the strand's own reading). The earlier
  statement that the legacy fallback of the hold only denies was wrong and is
  corrected in `docs/LIMITATIONS.md`.
* **A provider usage limit that stops a QA role is booked as a rejected
  iteration.** It cost eight iterations in the runs recorded so far `[V26]`; the
  same limit in a planner is classified as a resumable block. The repair
  (failure-classes, the core of amendment A5's P2 item P2-43) is specified and
  not merged, so P2-43 reads MISSING `[V40]`. The orchestrator parked and
  resumed each affected run and did not treat the lost iteration as a verdict
  on the candidate. The eighth, the role-pane-lifecycle run's first iteration,
  is read from its run state (ledger O255).
* **The first prompt after an agent starts still stalls, and the recovery has a
  width limit.** Dispatch recovers (an Enter on its own prompt, once) instead of
  blocking, seven times in the runs that had the recovery `[V31]`, and since the
  prompt-threshold merge every role prompt goes through a pointer file so that
  the box can be verified. That is a recovery, not a fix of the startup race.
  The recovery compares the box with the pointer text and models a break only
  mid-word at exactly the box width, while Claude Code breaks at a word boundary
  when a line does not fit: in a 79-column pane (box width 76) the pointer's
  first line, 77 columns with its indentation, wrapped short of the width, the
  recovery refused as designed, and the run qfu4 was blocked at its first
  planner dispatch before any candidate; the same pointer text passed in a
  106-column pane. The strand that waits for the first prompt to be accepted
  and models the wrap is the next P2 strand, not started.
* **A role's own processes are ended before the freeze, with limits.** The
  role-pane lifecycle is merged together with a tests-only follow-up. Closing a
  pane still does not end its background descendants `[V32]`; HoH ends them
  itself, by mark and anchor, or names what it did not signal. Its first live
  use closed the planner and developer panes at turn end; the QA pane's release
  was refused because two marked processes had escaped the pane (named, never
  signalled), and the pane was gone without anyone closing it by hand. Tracked minor:
  a few extra mutants of the pane-count guard survive the tests (fail closed),
  a detached daemon adopted by a subreaper is documented as escaping, and a run
  state keeps a stale iteration-1 task after acceptance.
* **Context rollover has not run live.** The capsule, the state machine and the
  four commands are tested with fakes; no live succession has been run, so no P2
  row is proven by it. The draining states between the freeze and the validated
  successor are recorded and **not enforced**: nothing refuses `hoh start` or
  `hoh run` in that window, and before the handoff the predecessor is trusted
  to launch nothing. The first-prompt stall can lose the successor's pointer; the
  acknowledgement deadline then fails closed, the predecessor stays master, and
  the pointer is sent again or the command re-run. Derived facts are only as
  good as the code that derives them: a fact nobody derives is not checked.
  Open follow-up items (tracked HIGH, a prerequisite of the live canary): the
  capsule id is not validated, so an unverified capsule can place its
  create-only, owner-only acknowledgement file outside the rollover directory;
  the acquire is not atomic with the last verification, so a master gap is
  possible, never two masters; a relative `--root` never rolls over (it fails
  closed); a non-object input file raises instead of refusing; `hold` accepts a
  zero or negative interval. An automatic rotation policy (Layer B) is not
  built.
* **P2 is not closed.** Its gate has 17 requirements blocking and open, and 3
  exit conditions that no instrument measures yet `[V12]`. P2-33 to P2-37 read
  IMPLEMENTED_NOT_PROVEN because their durability evidence is stale; P2-11 needs
  a real reboot (DS2) that has never been run; P2-41 is PARTIAL; P2-42 reads
  PARTIAL `[V10d]` after the register edit that follows its merge, not PROVEN.
* **The planner re-types the specification's criteria** and nothing compares
  the planned command with the specification's text; a replay of 53 planner
  answers found 195 deviating checks in 42 answers `[V34]`.
* **The QA-gap gate is not merged**: a gap QA records as blocking does not block
  acceptance.
* **The storage steward has not reclaimed anything of VeriHarness's own**; at
  the real pass its state was NORMAL and it observed only `[V33]`.
* **Smaller tracked items.** The developer role has twice left a
  filesystem-wide `find /` running when its turn ended, each time stopped by the
  orchestrator (the specs had named scratch paths the role cannot reach; a rule
  against that is in place and the role prompt does not yet forbid the search);
  lint (15 findings) and the identifier check (4 files) are red at this commit;
  and the `tests` row of `docs/READINESS.md` is measured in a checkout with
  history and the runs directory, so it reads a different failure count than a
  history-less copy of the same tree, which fails 18 tests that need the git
  history, the runs directory or the host's units: two environments, not two
  versions of the code.
* **The board is red** (`TECHNICALLY_STABLE_READY = no`): tests, lint, the
  external CI, the export synchronisation, the benchmark freeze, the programme
  supervisor and others, each for a reason `docs/READINESS.md` states.
* **Not claimed:** that any figure measured for `v0.1.0` -- campaign,
  benchmark, skip counts -- describes this development line (they stay
  historical); that the exact-head external CI has run on these bytes (it has
  not); that long-duration unattended operation is demonstrated (it is not).

`docs/LIMITATIONS.md` opens with the current open limitations, the entries
resolved or changed since `v0.1.0`, and the historical references, in that
order. `paper/POSITION_PAPER_V2.md` is the account of the programme since the
tag, with its own figures in `paper/NUMBERS_V2.md` and its audit in
`paper/AUDIT_V2.md`; `paper/POSITION_PAPER.md` stays as published with
`v0.1.0`, with dated errata added.

<!-- END GENERATED: tools/changelog_from_release_notes.py -->

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-14

First stable tag. `RELEASE_NOTES.md` carries the full account, including the
measurements that do not flatter the harness; this section lists what changed.

### Added -- a baseline

- `docs/BENCHMARK_PROTOCOL.md`, frozen before the first cell of the first
  campaign ran: five tasks, three arms (plain agent / one `hoh run` / full
  control plane), a hidden test suite per task that decides the verdict, and a
  budget matched on role dispatches.
- `docs/BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md`, `docs/BENCHMARK_RESULTS_v2.md` and
  `docs/BENCHMARK_RESULTS_v3.md` -- three campaigns, none edited in the light
  of another. v2 is kept with `matched_budget_valid = NO`, which cannot be
  repaired after the fact and is not.
- `docs/benchmarks/v3/`: the pre-registration, its parked predecessor, the
  provenance record establishing from git objects that the exact registration
  bytes were committed before the first dispatch, the raw-result digests, and
  the post-campaign drift accounting.
- `tools/benchmark.py`, `tools/repetition_plan.py`, `tools/prereg.py`, and a
  second, independently written aggregation in
  `tests/test_v3_aggregation_agreement.py` that never imports the reporter and
  must agree with it on every figure.

### Added -- enforcement, where there had been description

- `Budgets.max_dispatches`, checked before the counter is charged and persisted
  before the provider call; shared by a node and its repair nodes; survives a
  restart. `RunVerdict.BUDGET_EXHAUSTED`, `HaltClass.BUDGET_EXHAUSTED` and a
  `BudgetExhausted` exception type, so exhaustion is never a generic failure.
- `tools/budget_evidence.py`: eleven controls at three ceilings, at least one of
  which must force the refusal inside an iteration, plus two falsifiers that
  delete the enforcement and must be detected.
- `tools/closure_e2e.py`: the positive path, at a budget measured from campaign
  v2 rather than chosen after a failure.
- `tools/meta_evidence.py --falsify`, `tools/confinement_evidence.py`,
  `tools/telemetry_audit.py`, `tools/exact_head_ci.py` and
  `tools/readiness.py`, which assembles the board.
- `CapabilityWitness.neu_bezeugen`, re-taking the baseline for named paths only,
  so a retry cannot launder a hostile write into it.

### Changed -- what a skip is allowed to mean

- `tests/conftest.py` now authorises an environment-gap skip only when
  `EXPORT_MANIFEST.json` declares that path excluded for the reason the test
  expects. Missing-and-included, missing-and-unclassified, missing-manifest and
  wrong-reason all fail instead of skipping.
  `tests/test_export_gap_guard.py` holds that with five negative controls.
- Dispatch counting reads a `provider_calls` field instead of counting log
  lines, which was wrong in both directions.

### Changed -- documentation

- `README.md` and `paper/POSITION_PAPER.md` gained the three campaigns in full
  and a section on what the harness demonstrably does, each item bound to
  evidence; `paper/NUMBERS.md` and `paper/AUDIT.md` gained the rows those
  numbers require.
- `docs/LIMITATIONS.md` grew rather than shrank.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-08

Interface changes made during this run, each replacing an earlier German-named equivalent that existed only inside this repository (never a public release):

### Changed -- CLI subcommands

- The goalbook subcommand family is now `hoh goal ...` (`list`, `propose`, `approve`, and related decisions), over a module renamed from `zielbuch.py` to `goalbook.py`.
- The quota-resume subcommand is now `resume-quota`, over a module renamed from `kontingent.py` to `quota.py`.

### Changed -- CLI flags

- Flags on the affected subcommands are now `--title`, `--description`, `--by`, and `--reason`, replacing their earlier German-named equivalents.

### Changed -- JSON output

- JSON output keys emitted by the goal and quota-resume commands were renamed to English -- for example `id`, `status`, `title`, `decided_by`, `by`, and `reason` -- so no command emits a German JSON key any more.

### Changed -- persisted schema

- The goalbook's persisted schema identifier is now `hoh-goalbook.v2`. The identifier is actually read and enforced on load: an unrecognized identifier is rejected by name instead of being guessed at, and a pre-existing `hoh-goalbook.v1` file is migrated rather than silently reinterpreted under the new field names.

### Added -- governance

- Added the seven public-repository governance files: `LICENSE`, `PROVENANCE.md`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` (this file), and `CITATION.cff`. `LICENSE` documents that no license has been chosen yet rather than asserting one.
## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-10 (release candidate)

### Added -- release-candidate documentation

- `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, stating the research-preview positioning, the real hurdles to using HoH, what changed on the way to this release candidate, and what is not yet claimed.
- `RC_GATE.md`, reporting the release-candidate gate condition by condition, each with a status and either structured evidence or the explicit `NOT_RUN` marker -- including the rows only an operator can fill in, such as git status and the still-undecided repository host.
- This section of `CHANGELOG.md`, naming the release candidate without disturbing the section above it.

### Not changed

No file outside these three was created, edited, deleted, or renamed to produce this release candidate. Nothing under `src/hoh/`, `tests/`, or `tools/` changed; `pyproject.toml` and `CITATION.cff` are untouched; the section above stands exactly as it was written.
